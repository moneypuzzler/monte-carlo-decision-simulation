# Monte Carlo Simulation for Strategic Decision-Making (A vs B)

This repository contains Python code for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to evaluate and compare two strategic options (Option A: Stable, Option B: Aggressive) under conditions of uncertainty. The simulation uses probabilistic modeling to provide insights into the potential outcomes of each strategy, aiding in informed decision-making.

## üìå Overview

The primary purpose of this simulation is to:
1.  Model two distinct strategic choices with different risk-return profiles.
2.  Simulate a large number of scenarios (10,000 by default) to generate distributions of potential outcomes for each option.
3.  Calculate key metrics such as:
    *   The probability of one option outperforming the other.
    *   The expected difference in returns between the options.
    *   The risk associated with the difference in returns (standard deviation).
    *   A utility-based comparison, using a logarithmic utility function to account for risk aversion.
4.  Visualize the results through a histogram of simulated outcomes and mean performance lines.

This code is intended for use in academic research, particularly in fields related to decision science, strategic management, finance, and operations research, where quantifying uncertainty is crucial.

## üîß Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib

These libraries can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Simulation

1.  Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib) installed.
2.  Download or clone the `monte_carlo_decision_simulation.py` file from this repository.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5.  Run the script using the following command:
    ```bash
    python monte_carlo_decision_simulation.py
    ```

## üìä Expected Output

Upon execution, the script will:
1.  Print a detailed summary of the simulation results to the console. This summary includes:
    *   The number of simulations conducted.
    *   A comparison of the strategic options, including the probability of Option B outperforming Option A, the expected return difference, and the risk difference.
    *   A utility analysis, showing the log-utility for each option and the utility advantage of one over the other.
2.  Save a plot named `monte_carlo_simulation_plot.png` in the same directory where the script is run. This plot will be a histogram showing the frequency distribution of simulated outcomes for both Option A and Option B, along with their respective mean values.

Example console output snippet:

## üí° Example Explanation for Use in Academic Paper (Methodology/Results Section)

"We employed a Monte Carlo simulation approach, implemented in Python (see [Your Name/Username], Year, DOI:10.5281/zenodo.15361366), to evaluate and compare two distinct strategic options under uncertainty: a stable, low-risk strategy (Option A) and an aggressive, high-risk strategy (Option B). Option A was modeled with an average outcome of 80 units (SD=10), while Option B was modeled with an average outcome of 110 units (SD=40). By simulating 10,000 scenarios, we quantified that Option B outperformed Option A in approximately X.XX% of the scenarios (actual percentage will vary per run, e.g., 76.26%), with an expected return advantage of Y.YY units (e.g., 29.37). Additionally, risk assessment revealed a significantly higher variability in Option B outcomes (standard deviation of the difference in returns: Z.ZZ, e.g., 41.16). To further refine decision-making analysis from a risk-averse perspective, we applied a logarithmic utility function, highlighting a utility advantage of Option B (e.g., 0.2058). This comprehensive probabilistic and utility-based analysis supports strategic decision-making by clearly delineating risk-return trade-offs."

*(Note: Replace X.XX, Y.YY, Z.ZZ, and other example values with the actual results from your specific simulation run if you modify parameters or if slight variations occur due to random sampling. The DOI should be updated once generated.)*
